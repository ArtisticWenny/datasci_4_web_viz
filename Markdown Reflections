## Markdown Relfections

- The issues I ran into were with shinyapps.io. Trying to install the packages and run the program. I replayed the class video to guide me as much as possible.
- for example in my terminal it stated "Error: Invalid value for 'DIRECTORY': Directory 'path/to/your/app' does not exist." when trying to deploy.
